Cloudedplane is an ancient and remote town, built upon a plain where a necromancer cult had once had a temple. The experiments done there by the ancient necromancers have left the town with evil presences being able to be felt in most parts of town. The ancient cult has recently been revived in the town, and the citizens live in fear of this cult.
