# Session 1
## Tavern in Cloudedplane
"So, that's how I lost the Anchor Bracelet," Grinwit told his companions after telling them the story of how he lost the family heirloom due to his addiction years earlier.

"Yeah, I remember hearing about that," Lisbeth said, "Dad was cranky for weeks. Said you had brought shame to the family."

"Yes, thank you for reminding me," Grinwit said sarcastically.

"Don't worry, Uncle Grin, I'm with you on this adventure!"

Lirathil said, maybe a bit unhappily, "Wherever Lisabeth goes, I go also."

"I haven't had an adventure in a good long time," the dwarf Drelil said, "I'm game."

Grinwit hadn't had any doubts about Drelil, who had been with Grinwit ever since Drelil had been banished from his people. He also hadn't had any doubt about his niece Lisbeth. He had been a little uncertain about Lirathil, though, but her loyalty to Lisbeth seemed unbreakable.

"So we head to Stormriver first thing in the morning!" Drelil declared.

> Oracle roll: Does anyone in the party object to this? (1) **No, and** they seem excited.

The party is excited to be setting off for an adventure.

> With that out of the way, let's see what's going on in the tavern. Oracle roll: is the tavern busy tonight? (1) **No, and** they're getting ready to close for the night.

"Hey, we're getting ready to close," the bartender said to the party, "Are y'all going to be much longer?"

The party takes that as their cue to leave, and decide to meet up first thing in the morning.

## Travel
> So, our party heads out first thing in the morning. They're traveling through a hex next to the river end, so let's consult our oracle: Does the river extend into this hex? (6) **Yes, and** it also runs through the town.
> Let's roll for the terrain of this hex, from [[Single Sheet Adventure.pdf]]. (6) Wasteland (let's say desert)
> Let's roll for Cloudedplane. (2) Same.
> Now, let's roll for an encounter from [[Tables from various sources]]. (6) Quiet trip.

Our party follows the road to Stormriver. There trip is uneventful and they arrive there mid-morning.

## Stormriver
> Let's first roll for terrain: (5) New (2) Woods
> Oracle roll: Since this is a forest, is this a village of elves? (Likely, due to the forest surroundings and it being related to chasing down an elvish heirloom) (1, 6) **Yes, and** they're friendly to our party.
> An idea just hit me! Oracle roll: Is this the hometown of the Crumwaller clan? **Yes, and** they're glad to see Grinwit and Lisbeth.

As soon as our party enters town, Grinwit and Lisbeth are immediately recognized and welcomed.

"Who's the dwarf?" Grinwit's father asked warily.

"This is Drelil," Grinwit answered, "He's a friend of mine, and I vouch for him!"

> Oracle roll: Does this satisfy Grinwit's father? (6) **No.**
> Let's come up with a name for Grinwit's father. I used [this generator](https://m.fantasynamegenerators.com/) to get a list of male elf names, and my favourite was Aeson (going to disregard the last name since he's obviously a Crumwaller).

"The dwarves have never been very friendly to Stormriver. I'm not sure he's going to be very welcome here," Aeson said.

"I vouch for him to, Haru[^1]!" Lisbeth declared.

> Oracle roll: does this satisfy Aeson? (Likely, with 2 elves vouching for him) (6, 6) **Yes**

Aeson smiles, "In that case, welcome! And who is this young lady?"

Lisbeth introduces Lirathil, "This is my best friend Lirathil. She was the only child in our town who accepted the half elvish mutt."

"Then you have my thanks for protecting my granddaughter. You shall always be welcomed in Stormriver!"

Aeson turns back to his son, and asks, "And to what do we owe this return of the prodigal son?"

"I have a lead on the location of the Anchor Bracelet!"

> Slow start, I know. Sorry, but hopefully it'll pick up next time!
> The regional hex map can be found at [[Map]]. It'll mostly be blank at this point, but this is a hexcrawl and we've just started.
> Until next time!
