[[../Wiki/Cloudedplane|Cloudedplane]] is an ancient and remote town, built upon a plain where a necromancer cult had once had a temple. The experiments done there by the ancient necromancers have left the town with evil presences being able to be felt in most parts of town. The ancient cult has recently been revived in the town, and the citizens live in fear of this cult.

Our adventurers were summoned to Cloudedplane. [[../Player Characters/Grinwit Crumwaller (Elf)|Grinwit]] has a quest for all four of them to go on. He gathered our party together with the promise of an even split of any treasures found.

Grinwit is an elf who has a history of addiction. He's overcome his addiction, but he had hit rock bottom when he had allowed a family heirloom (the [[../Wiki/Anchor Bracelet|Anchor Bracelet]]) to be stolen while high one day. He wants to get it back. He has a lead on where it might be, an acquaintance of a friend in a small village about two hexes away.
