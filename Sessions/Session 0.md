## First Quest (Mainly from random rolls)
Location: 0406
Recover artifact
*What artifact?* bracelet, power
*What power does it bestow?* The wearer can cast Anchor, and only takes a level of fatigue if they fail a Willpower save.
*What is the location?* A village called Stormriver. He has a lead about someone who knows where it is that lives in that village.
*Is there a river that goes through Stormriver?* (Extremely likely, due to the name) Yes. (I'm going to roll two random hexes adjacent to Stormriver by rolling 2 six sided dice, 1 directly north and going clockwise. When in a hex adjacent to the river ends, I'll ask the oracle if the river continues to through that hex.)
*Is there a road between Cloudedplane and Stormriver?* (Likely, due to the distance between them.) Yes.

[Cloudedplane](../Wiki/Cloudedplane.md) is an ancient and remote town, built upon a plain where a necromancer cult had once had a temple. The experiments done there by the ancient necromancers have left the town with evil presences being able to be felt in most parts of town. The ancient cult has recently been revived in the town, and the citizens live in fear of this cult.

Our adventurers were summoned to Cloudedplane. [Grinwit](../Player%20Characters/Grinwit%20Crumwaller%20(Elf).md) has a quest for all four of them to go on. He gathered our party together with the promise of an even split of any treasures found.

Grinwit is an elf who has a history of addiction. He's overcome his addiction, but he had hit rock bottom when he had allowed a family heirloom (the [Anchor Bracelet](../Wiki/Anchor%20Bracelet.md)) to be stolen while high one day. He wants to get it back. He has a lead on where it might be, an acquaintance of a friend in a small village about two hexes away.
